# Introduction-to-Python

Some simple resources for learning Python.

This project is a collection of some python scripts and Jupyter notebooks
that aim to show the reader tha main features of the Python language. The
collection also points to some useful tools in developing Python code.

To run these files you'll need to have Python and Jupyter installed.

You can get both of these with the Anaconda Python distribution: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.
It is by no means the only source, but it does conveniently install them both together. 

Once you've done the above, you can read the Getting Stared page: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/

After the steps above you should be able to run the code in these files.
